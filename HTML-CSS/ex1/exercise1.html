<ul>Here's what I like about lists:
    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
    <li>That's about it</li>
    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
</ul>

<ol>When you make a list, do it in this order:
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
    <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
        </ul>
    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
</ol>

    <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>

    <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b></li>
</ul>
