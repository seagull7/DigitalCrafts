<p> I graduted in 2016 from Texas A+M with a degree in animal science and will be moving back to Phoenix just a few days before school for good. I love disc golf, soccer, league of legends, and am a huge nerd at heart. I have taken some coding classes but am effectively a beginner and looking forward to learning. <br> <br>oh and if you made it this far down, heres a prize, a pic of me and my wife! </p>
